/*

Create a dynamic object named dhoni of the following class. Donâ€™t use a constructor here, that means you need to fill the data by yourself.

Cricketer
{
	jersey_no;
	country;
}

Then make another dynamic object named kohli and copy the data of the dhoni object to kohli and after that delete the dhoni object. Then print the jersey_no and country of kohli object.


---------Note: At first try to do this, kohli=dhoni and see if it gives the correct output. If not, then think deeply why it didnâ€™t work and try to copy the data manually like kohli->jersey_no=dhoni->jersey_no;
